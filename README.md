# AudioArchive PWA Project
---
Hello, World!    
This is apart of a school assignment with the goal of creating a PWA.

I've chosen to make a web app where you can **record** something with your device's **microphone**, and with that recording you can:
- Give it a title, description, and rating
- Play it back with controls (and maybe even a cool visualisation)
- Export it to different formats (mp3, wav, ogg, flac, ...)

The SQL database dump (currently without test data) is located in:  
`server/src/db/AudioArchiveDB.sql`

Shoutouts to [Hosain](https://github.com/hossaini310) for making the Vue + Quasar template
