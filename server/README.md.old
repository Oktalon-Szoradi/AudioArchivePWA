# Express Server Template

This is an Express server template that includes PostgreSQL support, providing a quick and easy starting point for building web applications.

## Usage

To use this template, run the following command to generate a new project based on this template:

```
npx degit hossaini310/express-postgres-templ your-project
```

This will create a new directory called `your-project` that contains the files from this template. Next, navigate to the new directory and install the required dependencies with `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, the server can be started with `npm run dev` which will start a development server that will automatically restart when files are changed. For production, you can use `npm run start` which will start a production server.

### Setup

The following steps are required to set up and use this template:

1. Generate a new project based on this template with the command:
   `npx degit hossaini310/express-postgres-templ your-project`
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the variables from the `.env.example` file
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Start the production server with `npm run start`
